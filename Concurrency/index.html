      <h5>Interruption Training</h5>

      <p>Concurrency helps you become a better multitasker through a method called <strong>interruption
        training.</strong></p>

      <p>Becoming better at multitasking means you can handle more tasks throughout the day and get more done, simply by
        not being too attached to any single task.</p>

      <p>The more attached you are to a task, the more resistant you'll be to performing other tasks.</p>

      <p>Concurrency interrupts you throughout the day to solve simple puzzle problems that require a minute your
        attention. After you've finished, you can resume the task you were previously doing.</p>

      <p>By doing this constantly, you train your brain to become better at context switching, which means you can more
        efficiently take care of multiple tasks in a short amount of time.

      <h5>The Science</h5>

      <p>"We found that a key limitation to efficient multitasking is the speed with which our prefrontal cortex
        processes information, and that this speed can be drastically increased through training and practice.”</p>

      <p>— Paul E. Dux, Researcher at University of Queensland</p>

      <p>"Practice enables our brain to process each task more quickly through this bottleneck, speeding up performance
        overall."</p>

      <p>— René Marois, associate professor of psychology at Vanderbilt University</p>

      <p>From the Neuron Journal, July 16, 2009. “Training Improves Multitasking Performance by Increasing the Speed of
        Information Processing in Human Prefrontal Cortex”</p>

      <div class="ques">
        <strong>Can I modify my interruption schedule?</strong>

        <p>Yes, interruption training is on only at the times you specify. We recommend it to be enabled during your
          busiest times, typically weekdays from 9:00am to 6:00pm.</p>
